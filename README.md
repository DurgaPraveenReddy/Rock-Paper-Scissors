# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) Project

### 🚀 Overview
This is my **first major project** implemented using JavaScript! It showcases the core logic behind the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

### ✨ Key Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I gained practical experience in several core JavaScript concepts:

* **Conditional Logic:** Effectively using comprehensive conditional structures (**if/else** and **if/else if/else**), combined with essential **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) and **comparison operators** (`==`, `===`, `!=`, etc.), to precisely define the game's win/loss/tie conditions.
* **Function Declarations:** Implementing and understanding the difference between various function types:
    * **Arrow Functions**
    * **Function Expressions**
    * **Standard/Normal Function Declarations**
* **Function Execution & Scope:** Gaining a solid grasp of **function calls** and how **variable scope** (local vs. global) affects function behavior.
